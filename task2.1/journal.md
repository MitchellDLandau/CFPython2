# Journal for task 2.1

## Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?

A framework gives me something to start with so I do not need to design or code everything which would help you get started. The downside is that you have to follow the capabilities and pre determined plan and layout that the framework provides and you do not get to have complete control over everything. 

## In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?

With MVC you have to dictate and state the format of the data that you are working with and be more active in the desing of the database. With MVT a framework does not need you to write the format or endpoints to get the data the framework can handle a lot of this and you just need to decide the information that is presented to the user. 

## Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
### What do you want to learn about Django? 

I would like to learn more about the connection of python to the front end of projects and how the end user will interact with them. I see the power of Python however I have not seen its usefulness to and end user and only how useful it is to the developer. 

### What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 

I would like to see how back end databases and the front end presentation to the user works with python. This could be useful to me in the future development of my own recipe application. 

### Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

I had already made plans to work on a recipe application for my families recipes. This would allow them to make grocery lists and meal plan for the week along with adding new recipes for the whole family to try and have access to.
